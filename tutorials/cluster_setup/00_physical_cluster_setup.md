## Build a HPC-Cluster with Raspberry Pis

This tutorial describes how to set up the physical part of our Raspberry Pi Cluster with 5 Nodes.

### Hardware-List

* 1× Raspberry Pi Rack
* 5× 1m Ethernet cables
* 1x 2m Ethernet cables
* 5× USB-C to USB 2.0
* 5× Micro SD card (128 GB)
* 1x SD card USB reader
* 1x Ethernet to USB Adapter
* 1x Ethernet switch
* 1x Power supply for Ethernet switch
* 1x Anker power supply and power cord

### Connecting All Components

Connect the USB C to USB 2.0 cables into the Anker power supply and the Ethernet cables into the switch and the Pis. Lastly connect the USB Ethernet Dongle to your laptop and connect an Ethernet cable to the Dongle and the Pi switch. Power on the Switch and Anker power supply. The cluster should look similar to the following image.
