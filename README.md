# Pi-Cluster

Several scripts for Ubuntu to create a Pi Cluster with Hadoop to run a count example

# Usage

Copy `hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz`, `jdk-8u371-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` & `pishrink.sh` into the `./dependencies` folder & install `sshpass`.
Look in the scripts & read the usage info in the first lines.
